Qt / QtCreator:
use Qt creator v >= 5.5.1



Tetgen:
you can download the lib at http://wias-berlin.de/software/index.jsp?id=TetGen&lang=1
you need to compile the library, for that:
- make sure to uncomment: #define TETLIBRARY in tetgen.h (they use a different syntax otherwise, i don't know why)
- then either :
  a) run: make tetlib, and add the created library in your .pro file
  OR
  b) add tetgen.h, tetgen.cxx, predicates.cxx to your .pro file



libQGLViewer:
make sure you find the version 2.6.1, they changed something in the latest versions, and I don't get my projects to compile anymore.
- go to QGLViewer/
- open QGLViewer.pro with Qt creator
- chose a version of Qt that is more recent (>=) than 5.5.1
- chose QGLViewer/ as compiling repertory
- execute (it will complain, and ask for an executable, but do not care and close Qt creator, just make sure that the library -- either .so or .a on linux -- has been created).



Eigen:
do not compile, use headers only
